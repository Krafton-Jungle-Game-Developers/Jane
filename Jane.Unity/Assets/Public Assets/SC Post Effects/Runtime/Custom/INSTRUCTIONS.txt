1: Create a Shader Graph, following the layout of the "BasicPostProcessing_Example" graph. 

You must always use the "Screen Position (Raw)" and "Get Source Image" node as a base. From here on, you can modify the screen image however you like!

2: Create a new material that's using the shader you've just created

3: Add a "CustomEffectRenderFeature" to the renderer, then assign the material in the "Material" slot

The effect will now render to the screen.

Note: You can add multiple instances of the "CustomEffectRenderFeature" pass, to stack effects.
